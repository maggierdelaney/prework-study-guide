# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create a webpage that allows students in the coding bootcamp to easily find study topics. The project was built to improve organization and efficicency of studying for the students. It solves the problem of being able to quickly find a desired topic with the organized list. I learned all about the uses of HTML, CSS and JacaScript in the process.
